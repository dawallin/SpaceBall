# SpaceBall

SpaceBall is a mobile-first 3D web game concept inspired by the classic mechanical toy where a metal ball rolls between two adjustable rails. The goal is to control the gap and tilt so the ball drops through the scoring zone at the right moment.

## Repository layout
- `AGENTS.md` — global guidelines for contributors and automation agents.
- `docs/` — planning material and behaviour specifications.
  - `docs/specs/` — BDD-style `.feature` files that define expected gameplay behaviour.
- `src/` — (to be created) front-end implementation using modern JavaScript and a lightweight 3D engine such as Babylon.js.

## Getting started
1. Review the `.feature` files under `docs/specs/` to understand the target behaviours.
2. Plan implementation tasks that trace back to one or more scenarios.
3. Keep the experience static so it can be deployed to GitHub Pages without a backend.
