# Space Ball Design Reference

The sketch titled **Space Ball Concept** (store it at `docs/assets/space_ball_sketch.png`) illustrates the mobile portrait layout for the plinko-style scoring board. Use this image as the canonical visual reference when updating gameplay or UI specs.

- Mercury, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, and Pluto scoring pockets are aligned vertically beneath the apex of the rails.
- Score values increase as the ball drops lower, with Pluto representing the highest-value goal at the bottom center.
- The player's thumbs pinch the rails near the base, reinforcing the touch-control scenarios described in `docs/specs/touch_controls.feature`.

When refining behaviour-driven specs, add a comment noting this asset so future contributors understand the intended arrangement.
