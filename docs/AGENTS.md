# Documentation Guidelines

- Place high-level design documents, architecture notes, and planning material within this directory.
- Any time gameplay rules or UX flows change, synchronise the updates across the relevant `.feature` files and supporting markdown docs.
- Keep documentation concise and actionable for agents; avoid speculative content without implementation plans.
