# Space Ball Asset Catalogue

Store shared reference imagery and concept sketches in this directory so they can be linked from the behavioural specs.

## Adding a New Visual Reference
- Save the asset using a descriptive snake_case filename (for example, `space_ball_sketch.png`).
- Commit binary images directly to the repository; avoid external links so the specs remain self-contained.
- Reference the asset path from the relevant `.feature` file using a comment or Background note to make the association explicit.
